What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What did not work was me not reading all the directions before attempting this assignment! What did work was going through each method on both files and using that as hints as how to write my own code. Not sure if was cheating, but at lot of the functions/code lines that I used to complete the assignment came from code lines that were already written. I had to just modify it a bit to accommodate what I needed it to do. That said, doing this gave me a better understanding of how the methods co-work with each-other. Thus, I 100%%%%% recommend someone who takes this course to do this. Also, I googled so may of the functions (I ONLY KNEW what PRINT() did) and asked so many questions to the wonderful TA because I did not know what I 99.99% of it was doing.  Now, I probably only understant 50% of it, but I have a better understanding of how pinging (reciving and sending), ICMP, Checksum, unpacking/packing, and sockets, which I think was the ultimately the goal. 

Test your `ping` and `traceroute` programs on 4 target hosts, each on a different continent and include the output below.
